          <h2 class="section-heading">Her Story</h2>
          <p class="text-faded" align="justify">It was a beautiful, perfect  summer day in about mid-August of 2014. It was almost my birthday I was going to be 31. I signed up for a service project at my church where we were to meet at Love Park to do random acts of kindness around downtown Philadelphia. My church has different campuses, and usually for service projects we all come together, so you’re always meeting new people.  I almost didn’t go that day, because I was tired and got somewhat turned around trying to get there, but I made it. When I got there I noticed, Justin. He had a nice smile, and I thought “he looks like a handsome and happy guy… I wonder if we’ll wind up in the same group?...” and we did!  In the brief time we spent together I thought we really connected and he seemed like a really good guy, and someone I was immediately comfortable with, like an old friend…. Then at the end of the outing he asked for the digits and the rest is history.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">His Story</h2>
          <p class="text-faded" align="justify">Being new to Philadelphia, I was looking to explore the city since moving from the suburbs. I recently started attending a church called Epic Church in the city and decided to sign up for a community service project the church organized called Random Acts of Kindness. On a sunny Philadelphia morning, roughly 80 people meet in Love Park and were divided into teams. Terese and I were placed in the same team along with two other people. To be honest, I did not pay too much attention to Terese in the beginning. Those that know me well, know that I can be extremely competitive at times. Since the Random Acts of Kindness activity was like a scavenger hunt throughout the city, I had laser focus of getting every activity marked off on our checklist. By the late afternoon, all the teams met back at Love Park to see what team was able to complete the most random acts of kindness. Our team lost. After the realization of our team’s defeat, the scales fell from my eyes and I realized I should ask this beautiful woman for her phone number. We exchanged digits; who knew I would walk away a big winner despite losing the event.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Proposal</h2>
<hr class="light">
<p class="text-faded" align="justify">When I made the decision to propose to Terese, I knew exactly where I would ask her to be my wife. Love Park. It was where we met and why not make it the place to propose. After I asked permission from Mr. Johnson for his daughter’s hand in marriage, I started contemplating how I could get Terese and I to go to Love Park without her catching onto my plan. I sought the assistance of our friends, Tre and Helen, who coordinate our small weekly church group. With their help, we came up with the idea of having dinner at a restaurant that would require Terese and I to walk through Love Park. Since we would regularly get together for dinner in the city, it would not be anything unusual. Also, it would work out perfectly because Love Park is commonly used as a shortcut when walking in the city. She wouldn't suspect anything.
</p>

<p class="text-faded" align="justify">A week before I proposed, I was in New York City on a business trip and I got the opportunity to meet the actress, Shanice Williams, who played Dorothy in The Wiz Live! that aired live on NBC. I asked Shanice if she would assist me with proposing by recording a short video of her telling Terese why she should marry me. Shanice agreed to record the clip for me. Since Terese had participated in a stage production of The Wiz during high school, I thought the video clip would be special to her.</p>

<p class="text-faded" align="justify">
The morning of the day I planned on proposing, I woke up and I decided that I needed to clear my mind to prevent from getting nervous, so I went to see Star Wars The Force Awakens at 7am. Probably the most nerdiest thing I have ever done. That evening, I picked up Terese from her apartment and we drove into the city and parked my car. We started to walk toward the restaurant and go through Love Park. Since it was Christmas time, Love Park morphs into “Christmas Village” so the park was decorated beautifully with Christmas lights, decorations, and a tree.  As we were chatting about the decorations and vendors that are setup in the park, I tell Terese that I saw this funny video online today. I pulled up the video of The Wiz Live!’s Dororthy on my phone and played it for her. As the video is playing, I got down on one knee and asked Terese to marry me. With a complete surprise on her face and joyful tears she said yes. After Terese said yes, a close friend of mine, met us to take a few photos in front of the landmark LOVE statue. We then headed onto dinner where we met our friends who congratulated us on our engagement.

If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”
